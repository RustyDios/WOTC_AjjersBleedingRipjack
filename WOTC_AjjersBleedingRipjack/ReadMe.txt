[h1] What Does This Mod Do ? [/h1]
Adds a bleeding damage effect to the four default Skirmisher abilities

[h1] Config? [/h1]
Completely. You can change what abilities get the bleeding effect, number turns, damage and chance to proc.
Also adds the effect to the Proficiency Skirmisher abilities (except Rip and Tear)

[h1] Issues [/h1]
The Proficiency Skirmisher ability Rip and Tear, targets the holder on mission start to give them a shredding effect, this also means it cannot grant a bleeding effect.
